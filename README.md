# pingpong
:)

made using python
very basic, just to get back into it
there's a few mistake concerning the paddles (it doesn't always detect the collision between the ball and the paddle on the extremeties)

it could be improved by adding a display of the winner at the end (it is currently done in the termninal)
- if i have time i will import time and use the sleep function to delay the closing of the window, to display the winner
